# Inline maths example

There are different formulas that can be written inline, $\forall x > 0$.  
Also, we can write $x^2_3 + x_2 / x_1$

# This is an example of equation display mode
This a quadratic equation:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

This is another example   $\sum_{n=1}^{10}\frac{1}{n}$
Writing same example as equation 

$$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\frac{1}{n}$$
