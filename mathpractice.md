# Inline maths example

There are different formulas that can be written inline, $\forall x > 0$.  
Also, we can write $x^2_3 + x_2 / x_1$

# This is an example of equation display mode
This a quadratic equation:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

This is another example   $\sum_{n=1}^{10}\frac{1}{n}$
Writing same example as equation 

$$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\frac{1}{n}$$

# Greek letters.
This is trying out greek letters. I can write either $\omega$ or $\Omega$. This is not an error, it's just a way of writing. I will instead write an error as $\epsilon$ or better still $\varepsilon$.

I have others I can play with, follow me below to see.

- $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are Greek letters
- $\pi \approx 3.14159$
- $\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
- $\int_0^1 x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3}$
